# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier using Tensorflow

I created this project to learn how to use Tensoflow for machine learning projects, having already learnt machine learning theory as part of the Northwestern University CS 349 course. 

This project creates a model that classifies handwritten text from the famous MNIST dataset, and creates an interactive blackboard with Pygame to classify handwritten numbers.
